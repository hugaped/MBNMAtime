#' network connectivity and facilitate evidence synthesis, resulting in 19 treatments of 7 agents included
#' in the network. Standard deviations have been imputed for 181 observations.

#' Studies of alogliptin for lowering blood glucose concentration in patients with type II diabetes
#'
#' A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing different doses of
#' alogliptin with placebo \insertCite{langford2016}{MBNMAtime}. The systematic review was simply performed and was intended to
#' provide data to illustrate a statistical methodology rather than for clinical inference. Alogliptin is
#' a treatment aimed at reducing blood glucose concentration in type II diabetes. The outcome is continuous,
#' and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up.
#' The dataset includes 14 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 5
#' different doses of alogliptin with placebo, leading to 6 different treatments (combination of dose and agent)
#' within the network.

#' obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) \insertCite{karabis2013}{MBNMAtime}. Data are extracted from \insertCite{tallarita2019}{MBNMAtime}.
#' SEs were imputed for three studies, and number of patients randomised were imputed for one study (LAS 39) in which they were missing,
#' using the median standard deviation calculated from other studies in the
#' dataset. The outcome is trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), measured in litres and reported in each study arm as mean
#' change from baseline to follow-up. The dataset includes 13 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 2 treatments (Tiotropium and
