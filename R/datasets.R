#' Studies of combined treatments for reducing serum uric acid in patients with gout
#'
#' A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for lowering Serum Uric Acid (SUA) concentration in
#' patients with gout **(not published previously)**. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses
#' correspond to the mean change from baseline in SUA in mg/dL.
#' Treatments with similar doses have been pooled together to improve
#' network connectivity and facilitate evidence synthesis, resulting in 19 treatments of 7 agents included
#' in the network. Standard deviations have been imputed for 181 observations.

#' Studies of treatments for reducing body weight in patients with obesity
#'
#' A dataset from a systematic review of pharmacological treatments for reducing body weight in patients with
#' obesity. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data reponses are given as mean change from baseline in
#' body weight (KG). Overall there are 35 RCTs investigating
#' 26 treatments of 16 agents (/combinations of agents) in the network. Standard
#' deviations have been imputed for 421 observations.

#' Studies of alogliptin for lowering blood glucose concentration in patients with type II diabetes
#'
#' A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing different doses of
#' alogliptin with placebo \insertCite{langford2016}{MBNMAtime}. The systematic review was simply performed and was intended to
#' provide data to illustrate a statistical methodology rather than for clinical inference. Alogliptin is
#' a treatment aimed at reducing blood glucose concentration in type II diabetes. The outcome is continuous,
#' and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up.
#' The dataset includes 14 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 5
#' different doses of alogliptin with placebo, leading to 6 different treatments (combination of dose and agent)
#' within the network.
