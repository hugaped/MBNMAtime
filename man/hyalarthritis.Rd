\item \code{studyID} Study identifiers
\item \code{time} Numeric data indicating the time at which the observation was measured (given in weeks)
\item \code{treatment} Factor data indicating the treatment to which participants were randomised
\item \code{n} Numeric data indicating the number of participants randomised to each arm
\item \code{y} Numeric data indicating the mean change from baseline in HbA1c in a study arm

\description{
A dataset from of trials for pain reduction for patients with
osteoarthritis treated with HA-based viscosupplements\insertCite{jansen2015}{MBNMAtime}.
Data are reported in each study arm as mean change from baseline to follow-up
on a visual analogue scale (0-100).
The dataset includes 16 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 6 treatments
and placebo.
