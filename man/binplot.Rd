\usage{
binplot(
  network,
  overlay.nma = c(0, stats::quantile(network$data.ab$time)),
  method = "common",
  link = "identity",
  lim = "cred",
  plot.bins = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{network}{An object of class \code{"mb.network"}.}

\item{overlay.nma}{Numeric vector used to overlay the results from a standard NMA model that
"lumps" time-points together within the time bin ranges specified in \code{overlay.nma}.
The numbers in \code{overlay.nma} define the boundaries of the time bins within which to perform
a standard NMA. Length must be >=2, or can be left as \code{NULL} (the default) to indicate that no NMA
should be perfomed. \code{overlay.nma} can only be specified if \code{overlay.ref==TRUE}.
See Details for further information.}

\item{method}{Can take \code{"common"} or \code{"random"} to indicate the type of NMA model used to synthesise data points
given in \code{overlay.nma}. The default is \code{"random"} since this assumes different
time-points in \code{overlay.nma} have been lumped together to estimate the NMA.}

\item{link}{Can take either \code{"identity"} (the default),
\code{"log"} (for modelling Ratios of Means \insertCite{friedrich2011}{MBNMAtime}) or
\code{"smd"} (for modelling Standardised Mean Differences - although this also corresponds to an identity link function).}

\item{plot.bins}{Plot time bin boundaries as vertical dashed lines}

\item{...}{Arguments to be sent to R2jags.}

\section{Overlaying NMA results}{


\code{overlay.nma} indicates regions of the data (defined as "time bins") over which it may be reasonable to "lump" different
follow-up times from different studies together and assume a standard NMA model. For example:
\itemize{
\item \code{overlay.nma=c(5,10)} indicates a single NMA of studies with follow-up times \verb{>5} and \verb{<=10}
\item \code{overlay.nma=c(5,10,15)} indicates two NMAs should be performed of studies with follow-up times \verb{>5} and \verb{<=10}
of studies with follow-up times \verb{>10} and \verb{<=15}
}

When used with MBNMA (via \code{predict.mbnma()}) this allows comparison to MBNMA results over a specific range of time within each time bin.
It can be useful to assess which time-course function might be suitable when using \code{binplot()}, or to
to assess if the MBNMA predictions are in agreement with predictions from an NMA model when using \code{plot.mb.predict()}
for a specific range of time-points. This can be a general indicator of the fit of the time-course model.

However, it is important to note that the wider the range specified in \code{overlay.nma}, the more likely it is that different time-points
are included, and therefore that there is greater heterogeneity/inconsistency in the NMA model. If \code{overlay.nma} includes
several follow-up times for any study then only a single time-point will be taken (the one closest to \code{mean(overlay.nma)}).
The NMA predictions are plotted over the range specified in \code{overlay.nma} as a horizontal line, with the 95\%CrI shown by a grey
rectangle. The NMA predictions represent those for \emph{any time-points within this range} since they lump together data at
all these time-points. Predictions for treatments that are disconnected from
the network reference treatment at data points specified within \code{overlay.nma} cannot be estimated so are not included.

It is important to note that the NMA model is not necessarily the "correct" model, since it "lumps" different time-points
together and ignores potential differences in treatment effects that may arise from this. The wider the range specified in
\code{overlay.nma}, the greater the effect of "lumping" and the stronger the assumption of similarity between studies.

For an NMA model to be estimated and a corresponding prediction to be made from it, \strong{each} time bin
must include the network reference treatment (treatment=1) evaluated in at least 1 connected study in the time bin.
If a given time bin does not meet this criteria then an NMA will not be calculated for it.
