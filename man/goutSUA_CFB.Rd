\description{
A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for lowering Serum Uric Acid (SUA) concentration in
patients with gout \strong{(not published previously)}. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses
correspond to the mean change from baseline in SUA in mg/dL.
Overall there are 41 treatments of 8 agents in the network. Standard
deviations have been imputed for 181 observations.
