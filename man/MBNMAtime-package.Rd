\title{MBNMAtime for Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis of longitudinal (time-course) data}
\description{
MBNMAtime provides a collection of useful commands that allow users to run time-course
Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis (MBNMA).
}
\section{Introduction}{

MBNMAtime allows meta-analysis of studies with multiple follow-up measurements that can
account for time-course for a single or multiple treatment comparisons.

Including all available follow-up measurements within a study makes use of all the available
evidence in a way that maintains connectivity between treatments, and it does so in a way
that explains time-course, thus explaining heterogeneity and inconsistency that may be
present in a standard Network Meta-Analysis (NMA). All models and analyses are implemented
in a Bayesian framework, following an extension of the standard NMA methodology presented by
\insertCite{lu2004}{MBNMAtime} and are run in JAGS \insertCite{jags}{MBNMAtime}. Correlation between
time-points can be accounted for in the modeling framework. For full details of time-course MBNMA
methodology see \insertCite{pedder2019;textual}{MBNMAtime}.
}

\section{Workflow}{

Functions within \code{MBNMAtime} follow a clear pattern of use:
\enumerate{
\item Load your data into the correct format using \code{\link{mb.network}}
\item Specify a suitable time-course function and analyse your data using \code{\link{mb.run}}
\item Test for consistency using \code{\link{mb.nodesplit}} or by fitting Unrelated Mean Effects models
\item Examine model results using forest plots and treatment rankings
\item Use your model to predict responses or estimate treatment effects at specific time-points using \code{\link{predict.mbnma}}
}

At each of these stages there are a number of informative plots that can be generated to help make sense of your data and the models that you are fitting.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Generate an "mb.network" object that stores data in the correct format
network <- mb.network(osteopain)

# Generate a network plot
plot(network, label.distance=3)

# Analyse data using mb.run()
result <- mb.run(network, fun=tloglin())

# Time-course parameters can be explicitly specified
# Correlation between time-points can be accounted for
result <- mb.run(network,
  fun=temax(pool.emax="rel", method.emax="common",
    pool.et50="rel", method.et50="common"),
  rho="dunif(0,1)")

# Explore model fit statistics - plot residual deviances
devplot(result, n.iter=500)

# Generate a forest plot for model results
plot(result)

decision.treats <- c("Pl_0", "Ce_100", "Lu_400", "Ro_125",
  "Na_1000", "Na_1500", "Et_10")

# Predict responses for selected treatments
pred <- predict(result, time=c(0:10), E0=8,
  treats=decision.treats,
  ref.resp=subset(osteopain, treatment=="Pl_0"))

# Plot predicted response
plot(pred, disp.obs=TRUE)

# Rank by Area Under the time-course Curve
ranks <- rank(result, param="auc", lower_better=TRUE, n.iter=500,
  treats=decision.treats)

plot(ranks) # Plot histogram of rankings
cumrank(ranks) # Plot cumulative rankograms
