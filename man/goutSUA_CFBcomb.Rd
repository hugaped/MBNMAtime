\description{
A dataset from a systematic review of interventions for lowering Serum Uric Acid (SUA) concentration in
patients with gout \strong{(not published previously)}. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses
correspond to the mean change from baseline in SUA in mg/dL.
Treatments with similar doses have been pooled together to improve
network connectivity and facilitate evidence synthesis, resulting in 19 treatments of 7 agents included
in the network. Standard deviations have been imputed for 181 observations.
