\title{Get MBNMA model values}
\usage{
get.model.vals(mbnma, E0 = 0, level = "treatments", lim = "cred")
}
\arguments{
\item{mbnma}{An S3 object of class \code{"mbnma"} generated by running
a time-course MBNMA model}

\item{E0}{An object to indicate the value(s) to use for the response at time = 0
in the prediction. This can take a number of different formats depending
on how it will be used/calculated. The default is 0 but this may lead
to non-sensical predictions.
\itemize{
\item \code{numeric()} A single numeric value representing the deterministic response at time = 0
\item \code{formula()} A formula representing a stochastic distribution for the response
at time = 0. This is specified as a random number generator
(RNG) given as a string, and can take any RNG distribution for which a function exists
in R. For example: \code{~rnorm(n, 7, 0.5)}.
}}

\item{level}{Can take either \code{"treatment"} to make predictions for treatments, or \code{"class"} to make predictions for classes (in
which case \code{object} must be a class effect model).}

\item{lim}{Specifies calculation of either 95\% credible intervals (\code{lim="cred"}) or 95\% prediction intervals (\code{lim="pred"}).}
}
\value{
A list containing named elements that correspond to different
time-course parameters in \code{mbnma}. These elements contain MCMC results
either taken directly from \code{mbnma} or (in the case of random time-course
parameters specified as \code{method="random"}) randomly
generated using parameter values estimated in \code{mbnma}.

Additional elements contain the following values:
\itemize{
\item \code{timecourse} A character object that specifies the time-course used in \code{mbnma} in terms of
alpha, beta, mu, d and time. Consistency relative time-course parameters
are specified in terms of mu and d.
\item \code{time.params} A character vector
that indicates the different time-course parameters that are required for
the prediction
