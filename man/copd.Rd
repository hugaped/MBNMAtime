\title{Studies comparing Tiotropium, Aclidinium and Placebo for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}
\format{
A data frame in long format (one row per arm and study), with 80 rows and 6 variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{studyID} Study identifiers
\item \code{time} Numeric data indicating the time at which the observation was measured (given in weeks)
\item \code{y} Numeric data indicating the mean change from baseline in FEV1 (litres) in a study arm
\item \code{se} Numeric data indicating the standard error for the mean change from baseline in FEV1 in a study arm
\item \code{treatment} Factor data indicating the treatment to which participants were randomised
}

\description{
A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic
obstructure pulmonary disease (COPD) \insertCite{karabis2013}{MBNMAtime}. Data are extracted from \insertCite{tallarita2019}{MBNMAtime}.
SEs were imputed for three studies in which they were missing using the median standard deviation calculated from other studies in the
dataset. The outcome is trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), measured in litres and reported in each study arm as mean
change from baseline to follow-up. The dataset includes 13 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 2 treatments (Tiotropium and
Aclidinium) and placebo.
