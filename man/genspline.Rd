\title{#' Converts JAGS data held in \code{class("mbnma")} object to a data.frame
#'
#' @return A data frame similar in format to the data frame in an \code{"mb.network"} object.
#' @noRd
jagstonetwork <- function(mbnma) {
checkmate::assertClass(mbnma, "mbnma")}
\usage{
genspline(x, spline = "bs", knots = 1, degree = 1, max.time = max(x))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector indicating all time points available in the dataset}

\item{spline}{Indicates the type of spline function. Can be either a piecewise linear spline (\code{"ls"}),
natural cubic spline (\code{"ns"}), restricted cubic spline (\code{"rcs"}) or B-spline (\code{"bs"}).}

\item{knots}{The number/location of knots. If a single integer is given it indicates the number of knots (they will
be equally spaced across the range of doses). If a numeric vector is given it indicates the quantiles of the knots as
a proportion of the maximum study follow-up in the dataset. For example, if the maximum follow-up time in the dataset
is 10 months, \code{knots=c(0.1,0.5)} would indicate knots should be fitted at 1 and 5 months follow-up.}

\item{degree}{a positive integer giving the degree of the polynomial from which the spline function is composed
(e.g. \code{degree=3} represents a cubic spline).}

\item{max.time}{A number indicating the maximum time between which to calculate the spline function.}
}
\value{
A spline basis matrix with number of rows equal to \code{length(x)} and the number of columns equal to the number
of coefficients in the spline.
