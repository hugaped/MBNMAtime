## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use `MBNMAtime` to perform meta-analysis of studies with multiple follow-up measurements in order to account for time-course relationships within a single or multiple treatment comparisons. This can be performed by conducting Model-Based Network Meta-Analysis (MBNMA) to pool relative treatment effects.
