## Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to use `MBNMAtime` to perform meta-analysis of studies with multiple follow-up measurements in order to account for time-course relationships within single or multiple treatment comparisons. This can be performed by conducting Model-Based (Network) Meta-Analysis (MBNMA) to pool relative treatment effects. MBNMA models therefore estimate treatment effects over time (e.g. days, weeks, months). 

Including all available follow-up measurements within a study makes use of all the available evidence in a way that maintains connectivity between treatments and explains how the response of the treatment changes over time, thus accounting for heterogeneity and inconsistency that may be present from "lumping" together different time points in a standard Network Meta-Analysis (NMA). All models and analyses are implemented in a Bayesian framework, following an extension of the standard NMA methodology presented by [@lu2004] and are run in JAGS *(version 4.3.1 or later is required if using R version >= 4.2 with Windows Operating Systems)* [@jags]. For full details of time-course MBNMA methodology see Pedder et al. [-@pedder2019], and a simulation study exploring the statistical properties of the method is reported in Pedder et al. [-@pedder2020].

This package has been developed alongside `MBNMAdose`, a package that allows users to perform dose-response MBNMA to allow for modelling of dose-response relationships between different agents within a network. However, *they should not be loaded into R at the same time* as there are a number of functions with shared names that perform similar tasks yet are specific to dealing with either time-course *or* dose-response data.

Within the vignette, some models have not been evaluated, or have been run with fewer iterations than would be necessary to achieve convergence and produce valid results in practice. This has been done to speed up computation and rendering of the vignette.


### Workflow within the package

Functions within `MBNMAtime` follow a clear pattern of use:

1. Load your data into the correct format using `mb.network()`
2. Specify a suitable time-course function and analyse your data using `mb.run()`
3. Test for consistency using functions like `mb.nodesplit()`
4. Examine model results using forest plots and treatment rankings
5. Use your model to predict responses or estimate treatment effects at specific time-points using `predict()`

At each of these stages there are a number of informative graphs that can be generated to help understand the data and make decisions regarding model fitting.


## Datasets Included in the Package

### Pain relief in osteoarthritis

`osteopain` is from a systematic review of treatments for pain in osteoarthritis, used previously in Pedder et al. [-@pedder2019]. The outcome is pain measured on a continuous scale, and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean WOMAC pain score at different follow-up times. The dataset includes 30 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 29 different treatments (including placebo). `osteopain` is a data frame in long format (one row per time point, arm and study), with the variables `studyID`, `time`, `y`, `se`, `treatment` and `arm`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(osteopain), digits=2) 
```


### Alogliptin for lowering blood glucose concentration in type II diabetes

`alog_pcfb` is from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing different doses of alogliptin with placebo [@langford2016]. The systematic review was simply performed and was intended to provide data to illustrate a statistical methodology rather than for clinical inference. Alogliptin is a treatment aimed at reducing blood glucose concentration in type II diabetes. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to follow-up in studies of at least 12 weeks follow-up. The dataset includes 14 Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs), comparing 5 different doses of alogliptin with placebo (6 different treatments in total). `alog_pcfb` is a data frame in long format (one row per time point, arm and study), with the variables `studyID`, `clinicaltrialGov_ID`, `agent`, `dose`, `treatment`, `time`, `y`, `se`, and `N`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(alog_pcfb), digits=2) 
```


### Tiotropium, Aclidinium and Placebo for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

A dataset from a systematic review of Randomised-Controlled Trials (RCTs) for maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [@karabis2013]. Data are extracted from [@tallarita2019]. SEs were imputed for three studies, and number of patients randomised were imputed for one study (LAS 39) in which they were missing, using the median standard deviation calculated from other studies in the dataset. The outcome is trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), measured in litres and reported in each study arm as mean change from baseline to follow-up. The dataset includes 13 RCTs, comparing 2 treatments (Tiotropium and Aclidinium) and placebo. `copd` is a data frame in long format (one row per observation, arm and study), with the variables `studyID`, `time`, `y`, `se`, `treatment`, and `n`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(copd), digits=2) 
```


### Body weight reduction in obesity patients

`obesityBW_CFB` is from a systematic review of pharmacological treatments for obesity. The outcome measured is change from baseline in body weight (kg) at different follow-up times. 35 RCTs are included that investigate 26 different treatments (16 agents/agent combinations compared at different doses). `obesityBW_CFB` is a dataset in long format (one row per time point, arm and study), with the variables `studyID`, `time`, `y`, `se`, `N`, `treatment`, `arm`, `treatname`, `agent` and `class`. 

`class` is the class of a particular `agent` (e.g. Lipase inhibitor)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(obesityBW_CFB), digits=2) 
```


### Serum uric acid concentration in gout

`goutSUA_CFB` is from a systematic review of interventions for lowering Serum Uric Acid (SUA) concentration in patients with gout *[not published previously]*. The outcome is continuous, and aggregate data responses correspond to the mean change from baseline in SUA in mg/dL at different follow-up times. The dataset includes 28 RCTs, comparing 41 treatments (8 agents compared at different doses). `goutSUA_CFB` is a data frame in long format (one row per arm and study), with the variables `studyID`, `time`, `y`, `se`, `treatment`, `arm`, `class` and `treatname`.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(goutSUA_CFB), digits=2) 
```


## Inspecting the data

Before embarking on an analysis, the first step is to have a look at the raw data. Two features (network connectivity and time-course relationship) are particularly important for MBNMA. To investigate these we must first get our dataset into the right format for the package. We can do this using `mb.network()`. This requires specifying the desired treatment to use for the network reference treatment, though one will automatically be specified if not given. 

```{r network.pain}
# Using the pain dataset
network.pain <- mb.network(osteopain, reference = "Pl_0")
print(network.pain)
```

This takes a dataset with the columns:

* `studyID` Study identifiers
* `time` Numeric data indicating continuous follow-up times (e.g. days, weeks, months)
* `y` Numeric data indicating the mean response for a given observation
* `se` Numeric data indicating the standard error for a given observation
* `treatment` Treatment identifiers (can be numeric, factor or character)
* `class` An optional column indicating a particular class that may be shared by several treatments.
* `N` An optional column indicating the number of participants used to calculate the response at a given observation.

Additional columns can be included in the dataset. These will simply be added to the `mb.network` object, though will not affect the classification of the data.

`mb.network` then performs the following checks on the data:

* The dataset has the required column names
* There are no missing values
* All standard errors (SE) are positive
* Observations are made at the same time points in all arms of a study (i.e. the data are balanced)
* Class labels are consistent within each treatment
* Studies have at least two arms

Unless otherwise specified, `mb.network()` will automatically determine whether each study in the dataset is reported as change from baseline or absolute - studies that include a measurement at `time=0` are assumed to report absolute values, whilst those with no measurement at `time=0` are assumed to be change from baseline. This can also be explicitly specified by the user by including a logical vector for the argument `cfb` in `mb.network()` - `TRUE` indicates a study reports change from baseline, and `FALSE` indicates that it reports absolute values. 

Finally, `mb.network()` converts the data into an object of `class("mb.network")`, which contains indices for study arms and follow-up measurements, and generates numeric values for treatments and classes. By convention, treatments are numbered alphabetically, though if the original data for treatments is provided as a factor then the factor codes will be used. This then contains all the necessary information for subsequent `MBNMAtime` functions.


### Network connectivity

Looking at how the evidence in the network is connected and identifying which studies compare which treatments helps to understand which treatment effects can be estimated and what information will be helping to inform those estimates. A network plot can be generated which shows which treatments have been compared in head-to-head trials. Typically the thickness of connecting lines ("edges") is proportional to the number of studies that make a particular comparison and the size of treatment nodes ("vertices") is proportional to the total number of patients in the network who were randomised to a given treatment (provided `N` is included as a variable in the original dataset for `mb.network()`). 

In `MBNMAtime` these plots are generated using `igraph`, and can be plotted by calling `plot()`. The generated plots are objects of `class("igraph")` meaning that, in addition to the options specified in `plot()`, various `igraph` functions can be used to make more detailed edits to them.

```{r}
# Prepare data using the alogliptin dataset
network.alog <- mb.network(alog_pcfb, reference = "placebo")

# Plot network
plot(network.alog)
```


Within these network plots, treatments are automatically aligned in a circle (as the default) and can be tidied by shifting the label distance away from the nodes.

```{r, error = TRUE, purl = FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Draw network plot in a star layout using the gout dataset
network.gout <- mb.network(goutSUA_CFB, reference = "Plac")
plot(network.gout, layout=igraph::as_star(), label.distance = 5)
```
```{r, error = TRUE, purl = FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Draw network plot in a star layout using the gout dataset
network.gout <- mb.network(goutSUA_CFB, reference = "Plac")
plot(network.gout, layout=igraph::as_star(), label.distance = 5)
```

This command returns a warning stating that some treatments are not connected to the network reference treatment through any pathway of head-to-head evidence. The nodes that are coloured white represent these treatments. This means that it will not be possible to estimate relative effects for these treatments versus the network reference treatment (or any treatments connected to it). Several options exist to allow for inclusion of these treatments in an analysis which we will discuss in more detail later, but one approach is to assume a shared effect among treatments within the same class/agent. We can generate a network plot at the class level to examine this more closely, and can see that the network is connected at the class level.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(network.gout, level = "class", remove.loops = TRUE, label.distance = 5)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(plot(network.gout, level = "class", remove.loops = TRUE, label.distance = 5))
```

It is also possible to plot a network at the treatment level but to colour the treatments by the class that they belong to.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(network.gout, level = "treatment", v.color = "class", label.distance = 5)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressWarnings(plot(network.gout, level = "treatment", v.color = "class", label.distance = 5))
```


### Examining the time-course relationship

In order to consider which functional forms may be appropriate for modelling the time-course relationship, it is important to look at the responses in each arm plotted over time. This can easily be done using the `timeplot()` function on an object of `class("mb.network")`

```{r pain.time}
# Prepare data using the pain dataset
network.pain <- mb.network(osteopain, reference="Pl_0")

# Draw plot of raw study responses over time
timeplot(network.pain)
```

As the mean response for all treatments shows a rapid reduction in pain score followed by a levelling out after 2-5 weeks, an Integrated Two-component Prediction (ITP) time-course function might be a reasonable fit for this dataset. More complex alternatives could be Emax models (with or without a Hill parameter), fractional polynomials or a spline function.

Responses can also be plotted grouped by class rather than by treatment, and the relative effects between each treatment/class can be plotted instead of the absolute treatment responses. Since the MBNMA framework models the time-course on relative effects [@pedder2019] this can in fact make interpretation of the plots easier with regards to identifying a best-fitting time-course function. 

```{r obese.time, message=FALSE}
# Draw plot of within-study relative effects over time grouped by class
network.gout <- mb.network(goutSUA_CFBcomb)
timeplot(network.gout, level="class", plotby="rel")
```

Many of the profiles here appear to be quite different within the same class, which would suggest modelling class effects may be inappropriate for this dataset.

Another approach to investigate the time-course relationship is to perform several standard "lumped" NMAs at different time "bins", time periods within which we are assuming treatment effects are constant over time. This means that, for the purposes of this plot, rather than considering time as a continuous variable it is chunked up into segments.

We can do this within a single plot using `binplot()` and specifying the boundaries of multiple time bins. Separate NMAs are then performed within each time bin on data points from studies that fall within the time bin (only a single follow-up time is taken from each study to avoid double counting). `"fixed"` or `"random"` effects can be specified for the NMA. Note that the wider the time bin boundaries specified by the user, the larger the potential range of included follow-up times and this can introduce heterogeneity or inconsistency.

```{r, pain.binplot, results="hide"}
# Plot results for NMAs performed between 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-26 weeks
binplot(network.pain, overlay.nma=c(0,5,10,15,26))
```

Results are plotted versus the network reference and are plotted on the relevant scale depending on the function specified in `link` (in this case `"identity"` - i.e. mean differences versus Pl_0 are shown). Each time bin window is marked on the plot by vertical dashed lines. The NMA estimates within each time bin are plotted as a horizontal solid black line (the posterior median) with a shaded region indicating the 95% credible interval (prediction intervals can instead be plotted). The width of these shaded regions is equal to the range of study time-points included in the NMA performed within that time-bin, which may therefore be more narrow than the time bin specified in the `binplot()` command due to the follow-up times at which data is available in included studies. For example, for the time bin between 10-15 weeks, studies from the dataset included in this time bin have follow-ups between 12-13 weeks.

From this plot we can see that, whilst there clearly is a rapid onset of treatment efficacy within the first 5 weeks, indicated by a treatment effect <0 for most treatments. This treatment effect then persists and remains more or less constant for some treatments within later time bins, though for others (e.g. Ce_200, Ro_25, Na_1000, Na_1500, Va_10) there appears to be a loss of efficacy for later time bins, suggesting a more complex time-course function may be required to fully capture this relationship.


## Analysis using `mb.run()`

MBNMA models are fitted using `mb.run()` and they model treatment effects over time (e.g. days, weeks, months). This can just as easily be performed on datasets with many different treatments (network meta-analysis) as it can on datasets comparing only two treatments (pairwise meta-analysis) - the syntax is the same.

An object or `class("mb.network")` must be provided as the data for `mb.run()`. The key arguments within `mb.run()` involve specifying the functional form used to model the time-course, and the time-course parameters that comprise that functional form.


### Time-course functions

A number of different time-course functions can be fitted within `MBNMAtime` and the specific forms of the time-course parameters are defined by arguments within these functions, and this allows for a wide variety of parameterizations and time-course shapes. 

For further details check the help files for each function (e.g. `?tloglin()`). These functions, are then used as inputs for the `fun` argument in `mb.run()`.

* `tloglin()` - Log-linear function
* `titp()` - Integrated Two-Component Prediction (ITP) function
* `temax()` - Emax function
* `tpoly()` - Polynomial function (e.g. linear, quadratic)
* `tfpoly()` - Fractional polynomial function, as proposed previously for time-course NMA by Jansen [-@jansen2015].
* `tspline()` - Spline functions (includes B-splines, restricted cubic splines, natural splines and piecewise linear splines)
* `tuser()` - A time-course function that can be explicitly defined by the user

Time-course parameters within time-course functions are each defined by two arguments:

`pool` is used to define the approach used for the pooling of a given time-course parameter and can either of:

* `"rel"` indicates that relative effects (or mean differences) should be pooled for this time-course parameter. This preserves randomisation within included studies, are likely to vary less between studies (only due to effect modification), and allow for testing of consistency between direct and indirect evidence. Pooling follows the general approach for Network Meta-Analysis proposed by Lu and Ades [-@lu2004].
* `"abs"` indicates that study arms should be pooled across the whole network for this time-course parameter **independently of assigned treatment**. This implies using a single absolute value across the network for this time-course parameter, and may therefore be making strong assumptions of similarity between studies.

`method` is used to define the model used for meta-analysis for a given time-course parameter and can take either of:

* `"common"` implies that all studies estimate the same true effect (sometimes called a "fixed effect" meta-analysis)
* `"random"` implies that all studies estimate a separate true effect, but that each of these true effects vary randomly around a true mean effect. This approach allows for modelling of between-study heterogeneity.

Specifying pooling relative effects on all time-course parameters would imply performing a contrast-based synthesis, whereas specifying pooling absolute effects on all of them would imply performing an arm-based synthesis. There has been substantial discussion in the literature regarding the strengths and limitations of both these approaches [@dias2016; @hong2016; @karahalios2017].

Additional arguments within the function may also be used to specify the degree (e.g. for polynomials) or the number of knots or knot placement for splines.

#### Choosing a time-course function

Choice of time-course function involves a combination of data-driven, statistical information (plots, model fit statistics) and clinical/biological plausibility. `timeplot()` and `binplot()` functions can be used to observe the how the data differs at different time-points. This can help to understand, for example, whether the data monotonically increases or decreases, or whether there is a turning point or multiple turning-points within the time-course, and at which follow-up time(s) this might occur. This can also be guided by a clinical/biological knowledge/expectation of the shape of the time-course outside of the range of time-points for which data are available.

However, once several potential candidate time-course functions have been identified, selection between them (and of the specific specification of the time-course parameters in terms of absolute or relative effects) is best achieved using model fit statistics (e.g. Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), residual deviance).


### Output

`mb.run()` returns an object of `class(c("mbnma", "rjags"))`. `summary()` provides summary estimates of posterior densities for different parameters in the model, with some explanation regarding the way in which the model has been defined. Estimates are automatically reported for parameters of interest depending on the model specification (unless otherwise specified in `parameters.to.save`). Nodes that are automatically monitored (if present in the model) have the following interpretation:


#### Parameters modelled using relative effects

If pooling is relative (e.g. `pool.1="rel"`) for a given parameter then the named parameter (e.g. `emax`) or a numbered `d` parameter (e.g. `d.1`) corresponds to the pooled relative effect (or mean difference) for a given treatment compared to the network reference treatment for this time-course parameter.

`sd.` followed by a named (e.g. `emax`, `beta.1`) is the between-study SD (heterogeneity) for relative effects, reported if pooling for a time-course parameter is relative (e.g. `pool.1="rel"`) *and* the method for synthesis is random (e.g. `method.1="random`).

If class effects are modelled, parameters for classes are represented by the upper case name of the time-course parameter they correspond to. For example if `class.effect=list(emax="random")`, relative class effects will be represented by `EMAX`. The SD of the class effect (e.g. `sd.EMAX`, `sd.BETA.1`) is the SD of treatments within a class for the time-course parameter they correspond to.


#### Parameters modelled using absolute effects

If pooling is absolute (e.g. `pool.1="abs"`) for a given parameter then the named parameter (e.g. `emax`) or a numbered `beta` parameter (e.g. `beta.1`) corresponds to the estimated absolute effect for this time-course parameter.

For an absolute time-course parameter if the corresponding method is common (e.g. `method.1="common"`) the parameter corresponds to a single common parameter estimated across all studies and treatments. If the corresponding method is random (e.g. `method.1="random"`) then parameter is a mean effect around which the study-level absolute effects vary with SD corresponding to `sd.` followed by the named parameter (e.g. `sd.emax`, `sd.beta.1`).


#### Other model parameters

`rho` is the correlation coefficient for correlation between time-points. Its interpretation will differ depending on the covariance structure specified in `covar`.

`totresdev` is residual deviance of the model and `deviance` is the deviance of the model. Model fit statistics for `pD` (effective number of parameters) and `DIC` (Deviance Information Criterion) are also reported, with an explanation as to how they have been calculated.


#### Examples

An example MBNMA of the alogliptin dataset using a linear time-course function and common treatment effects that pool relative effects and assumes consistency between direct and indirect evidence can be performed as follows:

```{r, results="hide"}
# Run a linear time-course MBNMA
mbnma <- mb.run(network.alog, fun=tpoly(degree=1, pool.1="rel", method.1="common"))
```
```{r}
summary(mbnma)
```

For this model, the `d.1` parameters correspond to the 1st polynomial coefficient, and therefore are the linear gradient of the response over time for each treatment versus `placebo` - i.e. the mean difference for the change in efficacy for each treatment versus `placebo`. However, note that the residual deviance of the model is very high, suggesting (as we might expect) that this linear time-course function is a poor fit.

We may want to fit a more complex time-course function with two time-course parameters, such as an Emax function, yet limitations in the data might require that we make an assumption that one of the parameters does not vary by treatment. We can specify this by setting `pool` to be equal to `"abs"` for any parameters we choose.

```{r, results="hide"}
# Run an Emax time-course MBNMA with two parameters
mbnma <- mb.run(network.alog, fun=temax(
  pool.emax = "rel", method.emax="common",
  pool.et50 = "abs", method.et50="common"
))
```
```{r}
summary(mbnma)
```

In this case, the parameters are named following the Emax function specification. `emax` corresponds to the maximum effect for each treatment versus `placebo` (interpretable as a mean difference versus `placebo`), whereas `et50` is the log of the time at which 50% of the maximum response is achieved, **across all treatments in the network**. This assumes conditional constancy of absolute effects for this time-course parameter, which is typically a strong assumption. However, if there were limited data with which to inform this parameter (e.g. at earlier time-points) then such an assumption might be necessary, with the caveat that interpolation of response at time-points informed by this parameter may be more susceptible to bias. Further exploration of the degree of data required for reliable estimation of time-course parameters is given in Pedder et al. [-@pedder2020].


### Additional model specification with `mb.run()`

#### Correlation between time points

Within-study correlation between time points can easily be modeled using `mb.run()`, though this requires some additional considerations. The simplest approach is to incorporate correlation by using a variance adjustment [@jansen2015]. This avoids the need to use a multivariate normal likelihood (which is slow to run), and it assumes a common correlation between neighbouring time-points. This is achieved by using the argument `covar="varadj"`, which is the default in `mb.run()`. 

There are two alternative covariance structures can be modelled, though these require fitting a multivariate normal likelihood and therefore take longer to run. `covar="CS"` specifies fitting a Compound Symmetry covariance structure, whilst `covar="AR1"` specifies fitting an autoregressive AR1 covariance structure to the multivariate normal likelihood used for modelling the correlation between multiple time points within a study [@covstruct].

However, in addition to this, it's also necessary to specify a value for `rho`, and this can be assigned in one of two ways:

* Given as string representing a JAGS prior distribution [@jagsmanual], which indicates that the correlation should be estimated from the data. For example, to specify a prior that the correlation between time-points will be between 0 and 1 with equal probability you could set `rho="dunif(0,1)"`.
* Given as a single numeric value, which indicates that the correlation should be fixed to that value. For example, this value could be estimated externally from another study using Individual Participant Data. This could also be used to run a deterministic sensitivity analysis using different fixed values of `rho`.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Using the COPD dataset
network.copd <- mb.network(copd)

# Run an log-linear time-course MBNMA 
# that accounts for correlation between time points using variance adjustment
mbnma <- mb.run(network.copd, 
                fun=tloglin(pool.rate="rel", method.rate="random"),
                rho="dunif(0,1)", covar="varadj")
```

It is important to note that the covariance matrix must be positive semi-definite. This may mean that in order to satisfy this requirement for particular covariance matrix structures, the values that `rho` can take are limited. `rho` must always be bounded by -1 and 1, but even within this range some negative values for `rho` can result in a non positive matrix, which can lead to an error in the evaluation of the multivariate likelihood. If so, it may be necessary to further restrict the prior distribution.

### Link function

Time-course MBNMA can only be used for continuous outcomes *or those that can be summarised as continuous outcomes* (e.g. binary data can be converted to log-odds for inclusion in the model). Typically this means that users will analyse data using an identity link function, the default given to the `link` argument in `mb.run()`m which assumes an additive treatment effect (e.g. mean difference).

However, by specifying `link="log"` a user can model a log link and therefore assume a multiplicative treatment effect. For continuous data this models the treatment effect as a Ratio of Means (RoM) [@friedrich2011]. This also provides an advantage as the treatment effect is scale independent (i.e. studies measuring the same outcome using different measurement scales can be analysed simultaneously). However, within-study treatment effects must all be of the same direction (either positive or negative), and change from baseline measures must be adjusted so that they are also expressed as RoMs (log(follow-up) - log(baseline)) to avoid combining additive and multiplicative assumptions within the same analysis.

An alternative approach for modelling a measurement scale-independent treatment effect whilst still assuming additive treatment effects is to perform the analysis using Standardised Mean Differences (SMD). Whilst not strictly a different link function, this can be specified using `link="smd"`. Currently, `MBNMAtime` standardises treatment effects using the pooled baseline standard deviation (SD) in each study, to limit bias from any effect the treatment might have on SD. The resulting treatment effects are reported in units of SD as SMDs.

A more robust approach to minimise bias from estimation of within-study SD would be to use a single reference SD for standardisation of each scale included in the dataset. This is something `MBNMAtime` will incorporate in the future. For further details of analysis of continuous data that include discussion of both RoM and SMD see [@GMD2].


### Class effects

Shared effects between treatments within the network can be modelled using class effects. This requires assuming that different treatments have some sort of shared class effect, perhaps due to different (yet clinically similar) doses of the same agent or different treatments with a similar mechanism of action. One advantage of this is that class effects can be used to connect relative effects between treatments in a network that would be disconnected at the treatment level, but can be connected via classes at the class level. However, it is important to ensure that such an effect is clinically justifiable, as making these assumptions risks introducing heterogeneity/inconsistency.

Class effects can only be applied to time-course parameters which vary by treatment (`pool="rel"`), and class effects are modelled separately for each time-course parameter.

In `mb.run()` class effects are specified as a list, in which each element is named by the time-course parameter on which it should be modelled. The class effect for each time-course parameter can be either `"common"`, in which the effects for each treatment within the same class are constrained to a common class effect, or `"random"`, in which the effects for each treatment within the same class are assumed to be randomly distributed around a shared class mean.

```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Run a B-spline time-course MBNMA with a knot at 0.2 times the max follow-up
# Common class effect on beta.2, the 2nd spline coefficient
mbnma <- mb.run(network.gout, 
                fun=tspline(type="bs", knots=c(0.2),
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2="rel", method.2="random"),
                class.effect = list(beta.2="common"))

```
```{r}
summary(mbnma)
```

Mean class effects are given in the output as `D.2` parameters. These can be interpreted as the relative effect of each class versus the `Plac` (Placebo), for the 2nd spline coefficient (`beta.2`). Note the number of `D.2` parameters is therefore equal to the number of classes defined in the dataset.


### Additional arguments

Several additional arguments can be given to `mb.run()` that require further explanation.


#### Priors

Default vague priors for the model are as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  &\alpha_{i} \sim N(0,10000)\\
  &\boldsymbol{\mu}_{i} \sim N(0,10000)\\
  &\boldsymbol{d}_{t} \sim N(0,10000)\\
  &beta_{\phi} \sim N(0,10000)\\
  &D_{\phi,c} \sim N(0,1000)\\
  &\tau_{\phi} \sim N(0,400) \text{  limited to  } x \in [0,\infty]\\
  &\tau^D_{\phi} \sim N(0,400) \text{ limited to } x \in [0,\infty]\\
\end{aligned}
$$

* $\alpha_i$ is the response at time=0 in study $i$
* $\mu_i$ is a vector of study reference effects for each time-course parameter in study $i$. Where only a single time-course parameter is modelled using relative effects the prior is defined as $\mu_{i} \sim N(0,10000)$.
* $\boldsymbol{d}_{t}$ is a vector of pooled relative effects for treatment $t$ whose length is the number of time-course parameters in the model. Where only a single time-course parameter is modelled using relative effects the prior is defined as $d_{t} \sim N(0,10000)$.
* $\beta_{\phi}$ is the absolute effect for time-course parameter $\phi$ modelled independently of treatment
* $D_{\phi,c}$ is the class relative effect for time-course parameter $\phi$ in class $c$
* $\tau_{\phi}$ is the between-study SD for time-course parameter $\phi$
* $\tau^D_{\phi}$ is the within-class SD for time-course parameter $\phi$

Users may wish to change these, perhaps in order to use more/less informative priors, but also because the default prior distributions in some models may lead to errors when compiling/updating models. 

This can be more likely for certain types of models. For example some prior distributions may generate results that are too extreme for JAGS to compute, such as for time-course parameters that are powers (e.g. Emax functions with a Hill parameter or power parameters in fractional polynomials).

If the model fails during compilation/updating (i.e. due to a problem in JAGS), `mb.run()` will generate an error and return a list of arguments that `mb.run()` used to generate the model. Within this (as within a model that has run successfully), the priors used by the model (in JAGS syntax) are stored within `"model.arg"`.

In this way a model can first be run with vague priors and then rerun with different priors, perhaps to allow successful computation, perhaps to provide more informative priors, or perhaps to run a sensitivity analysis with different priors.

To change priors within a model, a list of replacements can be provided to `priors` in `mb.run()`. The name of each element is the name of the parameter to change (without indices) and the value of the element is the JAGS distribution to use for the prior. See the JAGS Manual [-@jagsmanual] for syntax details regarding specifying distributions. This can include censoring or truncation if desired. Only the priors to be changed need to be specified - priors for parameters that aren't specified will take default values. Note that in JAGS, normal distributions are specified using precision (1/variance) rather than SD.

For example, we may wish to specify a tighter prior for the between-study SD:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mbnma <- mb.run(network.copd, 
                fun=tloglin(pool.rate="rel", method.rate="random"),
                priors=list(rate="dnorm(0,2) T(0,)"))
```


#### pD (effective number of parameters)

The default value for `pd` in `mb.run()` is `pd="pv"`, which uses the rapid approach automatically calculated in the `R2jags` package as `pv = var(deviance)/2`. Whilst this is easy to calculate, it is only an approximation to the effective number of parameters, and may be numerically unstable [@gelman2003]. However, it has been shown to be reliable for model comparison in time-course MBNMA models in a simulation study [@pedder2020].

A more reliable method for estimating `pd` is `pd="pd.kl"`, which uses the Kullback-Leibler divergence [@plummer2008]. This is more reliable than the default method used in `R2jags` for calculating the effective number of parameters from non-linear models. The disadvantage of this approach is that it requires running additional MCMC iterations, so can be slightly slower to calculate.

A commonly-used approach in Bayesian models for calculating pD is the plug-in method (`pd="plugin"`) [@spiegelhalter2002]. However, this can sometimes result in negative non-sensical values due to skewed posterior distributions for deviance contributions that can arise when fitting non-linear models.

Finally, pD can also be calculated using an optimism adjustment (`pd="popt"`)  which allows for calculation of the penalized expected deviance [@plummer2008]. This adjustment allows for the fact that data used to estimate the model is the same as that used to assess its parsimony. As for `pd="pd.kl"`, it also requires running additional MCMC iterations.


#### Correlation between time-course parameters

Since MBNMAtime version 0.2.2, `mb.run()` no longer automatically models correlation between time-course parameters modeled using relative effects. 

However, this can be enabled by setting `corparam=TRUE`). Time-course parameters are typically correlated and this allows information on each parameter to help inform the other(s). The correlation is modeled using a multivariate normal distribution whose covariance matrix $\Sigma_t$ is modelled using a correlation defined by the parameter `rhoparam`. In previous versions, an inverse Wishart prior was used, though this has since been considered to overly constrain the model.


#### Arguments to be sent to JAGS

In addition to the arguments specific to `mb.run()` it is also possible to use any arguments to be sent to `R2jags::jags()`. Most of these relate to improving the performance of MCMC simulations in JAGS. Some of the key arguments that may be of interest are:

* `n.chains` The number of Markov chains to run (default is 3)
* `n.iter` The total number of iterations per MCMC chain
* `n.burnin` The number of iterations that are discarded to ensure iterations are only saved once chains have converged 
* `n.thin` The thinning rate which ensures that results are only saved for 1 in every `n.thin` iterations per chain. This can be increased to reduce autocorrelation in MCMC samples


## Model Selection

Detailed description of model selection based on statistical measures such as Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and residual deviance is outside the scope of this vignette. However, the following approach for model identification and selection is recommended in Pedder et al. [-@pedder2020], which also gives details on model fit statistics used for comparison:

1. Identify candidate time-course functions based on observed data and clinical/biological reasoning
2. Compare candidate time-course functions fitted with common relative treatment effects on all time-course parameters
3. If no candidate time-course functions converge successfully, absolute effects can be modeled on parameters for which convergence is problematic
4. Compare selected common effects model to model(s) with random effects on different time-course parameters
5. Compare model fitted with a univariate likelihood to one fitted with a multivariate likelihood

Finally the validity of the consistency assumption should be explored in the selected final model (see [Consistency Testing]). 

## MCMC Convergence

`MBNMAtime` runs Bayesian models in JAGS, which uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation [@jags]. However, the validity of results is reliant on the MCMC chains having converged successfully on the posterior densities of all parameters in the model. For highly parameterised models run on relatively limited data, as is often the case with MBNMA models, convergence can often be an challenge. Note that convergence is *necessary* to be able to compare models and evaluate model fit. However, successful convergence *does not* imply good model fit.

A full explanation of how to facilitate and to check for convergence is outside the scope of this vignette, but below are some simple steps for checking convergence. None of these steps alone ensures convergence has been successful, but interpretation of them jointly can provide strong evidence of it.

* Rhat values close to 1 (<1.1 is considered acceptable by some). These are shown for monitored parameters in the summary statistics table when an `"mbnma"` or `"nma"` object is printed.
* Trace plots that have a "fuzzy caterpillar" look that shows good mixing of MCMC chains
* Density plots that show a smooth posterior distribution that is similar across all chains
* Autocorrelation plots that show low autocorrelation between neighbouring MCMC iterations (i.e. low correlation at higher lags)

An HTML document with all the above convergence plots can easily be generated for all parameters in the model simultaneously using `mcmcplots::mcmcplot()`.

Two steps may improve convergence when using `MBNMAtime`. One step is to run models for more iterations (this can be done using the `n.iter` argument in `mb.run()`). It can take time for MCMC chains to converge, particularly for non-linear models with limited data. It is important to note that chains should only be monitored *after* they have converged - increasing the number of burn-in iterations ensures that this is the case (using the `n.burnin` argument in `mb.run()`). Another method to improve convergence is by providing more information to the model via informative priors.

For a detailed review of MCMC convergence assessment see Sinharay [-@sinharay].


## Post-Estimation

### Deviance plots

To assess how well a model fits the data, it can be useful to look at a plot of the contributions of each data point to the total deviance or residual deviance. This can be done using `devplot()`. As individual deviance contributions are not automatically monitored in the model, this might require the model to be run for additional iterations.

Results can be plotted either as a scatter plot (`plot.type="scatter"`) or a series of boxplots (`plot.type="box"`).

```{r, results="hide", fig.show="hold", eval=FALSE}
# Run a first-order fractional polynomial time-course MBNMA
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain, 
                fun=tfpoly(degree=1,
                          pool.1="rel", method.1="random",
                          method.power1=0.5))

# Plot a box-plot of deviance contributions (the default)
devplot(mbnma, n.iter=1000)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide", fig.show="hold"}
# Run a first-order fractional polynomial time-course MBNMA
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain, 
                fun=tfpoly(degree=1,
                          pool.1="rel", method.1="random",
                          method.power1=0.5), n.iter=5000)

# Plot a box-plot of deviance contributions (the default)
devplot(mbnma, n.iter=500)
```

From these plots we can see that whilst the model fit is typically better at later time points, it fits very poorly at earlier time points.

A function that appropriately captures the time-course shape should show a reasonably flat shape of deviance contributions (i.e. contributions should be similar across all time points).

If saved to an object, the output of `devplot()` contains the results for individual deviance contributions, and this can be used to identify any extreme outliers.


### Fitted values

Another approach for assessing model fit can be to plot the fitted values, using `fitplot()`. As with `devplot()`, this may require running additional model iterations to monitor `theta`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Plot fitted and observed values with treatment labels
fitplot(mbnma, n.iter=1000)
```

Fitted values are plotted as connecting lines and observed values in the original dataset are plotted as points. These plots can be used to identify if the model fits the data well for different treatments and at different parts of the time-course.


### Forest plots

Forest plots can be easily generated from MBNMA models using the `plot()` method on an `"mbnma"` object. By default this will plot a separate panel for each time-course parameter in the model. Forest plots can only be generated for parameters which vary by treatment/class.

```{r, results="hide"}
# Run a quadratic time-course MBNMA using the alogliptin dataset
mbnma <- mb.run(network.alog, 
                fun=tpoly(degree=2,
                          pool.1="rel", method.1="random",
                          pool.2="rel", method.2="common"
                          )
)

plot(mbnma)
```


### `get.relative()`: Calculating differences between treatments at a specified time-point

Although `mb.run()` estimates the effects for different treatments on different time-course parameters, these are not necessarily easy to draw conclusions from, particularly for time-course functions with less easily interpretable parameters. `get.relative()` allows users to calculate mean differences (or log-Ratio of Means if `mb.run(link="log")`) between treatments at a specified time-point even if a subset, or even none of the treatments have been investigated at that time-point in included RCTs. 

These results will then be reported on the scale on which the data were modeled (i.e. depending on the link function specified in `mb.run()`), rather than that of the specific time-course parameters. Within the matrices of results, mean differences/relative effects are shown as the row-defined treatment versus the column-defined treatment.

```{r}
allres <- get.relative(mbnma, time=20,
                       treats = c("alog_100", "alog_50", "placebo"))
print(allres)
```


`get.relative()` can also be used to perform a 2-stage MBNMA that allows synthesis of results from two different MBNMA models via a single common comparator. In an MBNMA model, all treatments must share the same time-course function. However, a 2-stage approach can enable fitting of different time-course functions to different sets ("subnetworks") of treatments. For example, some treatments may have rich time-course information, allowing for a more complex time-course function to be used, whereas others may be sparse, requiring a simpler time-course function.

Relative comparisons between treatments in the two datasets at specific follow-up times can then be estimated from MBNMA predicted effects versus a common comparator using the Bucher method and assuming consistency.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis', fig.cap="2-stage MBNMA: For clarity, 95%CrIs are not shown in the plots or tables but these are calculated and computed in `get.relative()`. Thick connecting lines in network plots indicate comparisons with rich time-course data that can be modelled with a more complex function (e.g. B-spline), thin connecting lines in network plots indicate comparisons with sparse time-course data that can only be modelled with a less complex function (e.g. BEST-ITP). Comparisons between treatments in different subnetworks that are not the network reference must be excluded (red dashed line in network plot)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/2stageMBNMA.png", dpi=250)
```


* Step 1: The network at a chosen network reference treatment (A) into subnetworks with rich and sparse time-course data.
* Step 2: Separate time-course MBNMAs are fitted to each subnetwork using a different time-course function, and relative effects versus the network reference treatment are predicted over time.
* Step 3: Bucher method is used to calculate predicted relative effects between all treatments at specific time-points of interest (e.g. ${S_{1}}$, ${S_{2}}$ and ${S_{3}}$). This can be done with `get.relative()` using the output from both MBNMA models in `mbnma` and `mbnma.add` arguments. For more details and an example see the function help file (`?get.relative`). 


### `rank()`: Ranking

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
load(system.file("extdata", "ranks.rda", package="MBNMAtime", mustWork = TRUE))
```

Rankings can be calculated for different time-course parameters from MBNMA models by using `rank()` on an `"mbnma"` object. Any parameter monitored in an MBNMA model that varies by treatment/class can be ranked. A vector of these is assigned to `params`. `lower_better` indicates whether negative scores should be ranked as "better" (`TRUE`) or "worse" (`FALSE`)

In addition, it is possible to rank the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular treatment by adding `"auc"` to the vector of `params` (included as the default). This will calculate the area under the predicted response over time, and will therefore be a function of all the time-course parameters in the model simultaneously. However, it will be dependent on the range of times chosen to integrate over (`int.range`), and a different choice of time-frame may lead to different treatment rankings. `"auc"` can also not currently be calculated from MBNMA models with more complex time-course functions (piecewise, fractional polynomials), nor with MBNMA models that use class effects.

```{r, results="hide", eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
# Identify quantile for knot at 1 week
timequant <- 1/max(network.pain$data.ab$time)

# Run a piecewise linear time-course MBNMA with a knot at 1 week
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=tspline(type="ls", knots = timequant,
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2 = "rel", method.2="common"))


# Rank results based on AUC (calculated 0-10 weeks), more negative slopes considered to be "better"
ranks <- rank(mbnma, params=c("auc", "d.2"), 
                    int.range=c(0,10),  lower_better = TRUE, n.iter=1000)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
save(ranks, file="inst/extdata/ranks.rda")
```
```{r, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
print(ranks)
```

The output is an object of `class("mb.rank")`, containing a list for each ranked parameter in `params`, which consists of a summary table of rankings and raw information on treatment ranking and probabilities. The summary median ranks with 95% credible intervals can be simply displayed using `print()`.

Histograms for ranking results can also be plotted using the `plot()` method, which takes the raw MCMC ranking results given in `rank.matrix` and plots the number of MCMC iterations the parameter value for each treatment was ranked a particular position.

```{r, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
# Ranking histograms for AUC
plot(ranks, params = "auc")
```

Cumulative rankograms indicating the probability of each treatment being ranked 1st, 2nd, etc. for each ranked parameter can also be plotted using `cumrank()`. These can be used to easily compare how different treatments rank for each ranked parameter simultaneously. By default, the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking curve (SUCRA) are also returned for each treatment and ranked parameter [@salanti2011].

```{r, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
# Cumulative ranking for all ranked parameters
cumrank(ranks)
```


### Prediction

After performing an MBNMA, responses can be predicted from the parameter estimates using `predict()` on an `"mbnma"` object. A number of important parameters need to be identified to make robust predictions. However, default values can be used that set values of zero for the reference treatment baseline and time-course parameters which indicates that mean differences / relative treatment effects should be estimated. For further information the help file can be accessed using `?predict.mbnma`.

One key parameter is `E0`, which defines what value(s) to use for the predicted mean at time = 0. A single numeric value can be given for `E0` to indicate a deterministic value, or a function representing a random number generator (RNG) distribution in R (stochastic) (e.g. `E0 = ~rnorm(n, 7, 0.2)`. These values can be identified for the population of interest from external data (e.g. observational/registry).

The more challenging parameter(s) to identify are those for the network reference treatment time-course, supplied to `predict()` in the `ref.resp` argument. For estimating mean differences / relative treatment effects over time this does not need to be specified since typically in an MBNMA, relative effects are estimated and the network reference effect is modeled as a nuisance parameter. However, for predicting mean responses over time we need to provide an input for the network reference treatment effect for all time-course parameters modeled using `pool="rel"` so that we can apply the relative effects estimated in our model to it. There are two options for providing these values.

The first approach is to give values for each time-course parameter modeled using relative effects to `ref.resp`. This is given as a list, with a separate named element for each time-course parameter. Each element can take either a single numeric value (deterministic), or a function representing a random number generator distribution in R (stochastic).

```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Run an Emax time-course MBNMA using the osteoarthritis dataset
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=temax(pool.emax="rel", method.emax="common",
                          pool.et50="abs", method.et50="common"),
                rho="dunif(0,1)", covar="varadj")
```
```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Run an Emax time-course MBNMA using the osteoarthritis dataset
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=temax(pool.emax="rel", method.emax="common",
                          pool.et50="abs", method.et50="common"),
                rho="dunif(0,1)", covar="varadj", n.iter=3000)
```
```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
# Specify placebo time-course parameters
ref.params <- list(emax=-2)

# Predict responses for a selection of treatments using a stochastic E0 and
# placebo parameters defined in ref.params to estimate the network reference treatment effect
pred <- predict(mbnma, treats=c("Pl_0", "Ce_200", "Du_90", "Et_60", 
                                        "Lu_400", "Na_1000", "Ox_44", "Ro_25",
                                        "Tr_300", "Va_20"),
                        E0=~rnorm(n, 8, 0.5), ref.resp=ref.params)

print(pred)
```

The second is to assign `ref.resp` a data frame composed of single-arm studies of the network reference treatment. A separate synthesis model for the reference treatment effect will then be run, and the values from this used as the prediction reference treatment effect. This dataset could be a series of observational studies measured at multiple follow-up times that closely match the population of interest for the prediction. Alternatively it could be a subset of data from the original RCT dataset used for the MBNMA model (though this may be less generalisable to the population of interest).

```{r, results="hide", message=FALSE, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
# Generate a dataset of network reference treatment responses over time
placebo.df <- network.pain$data.ab[network.pain$data.ab$treatment==1,]

# Predict responses for a selection of treatments using a deterministic E0 and 
#placebo.df to model the network reference treatment effect
pred <- predict(mbnma, treats=c("Pl_0", "Ce_200", "Du_90", "Et_60", 
                                        "Lu_400", "Na_1000", "Ox_44", "Ro_25",
                                        "Tr_300", "Va_20"),
                        E0=10, ref.resp=placebo.df)

print(pred)
```

It is also possible specify the time points for which to make predictions (`times`), given as a vector of positive numbers. If left as the default then the maximum follow-up in the dataset will be used as the upper limit for the range of predicted time-points.

An object of class `"mb.predict"` is returned, which is a list of summary tables and MCMC prediction matrices for each treatment, in addition to the original `mbnma` object. The `summary()` method can be used to print mean posterior predictions at each time point for each treatment.

Predicted values can also be plotted using the `plot()` method on an object of `class("mb.predict")`. Within the default arguments, the median predicted network reference treatment effect is overlaid on the predictions for each treatment. Setting `overlay.ref = FALSE` prevents this and causes the network reference treatment effect to be plotted as a separate panel. Shaded counts of observations in the original dataset at each predicted time point can be plotted over the 95% CrI for each treatment by setting `disp.obs = TRUE`.

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.12.3")}
plot(pred, overlay.ref=TRUE, disp.obs=TRUE)
```

This can be used to identify any extrapolation/interpretation of the time-course that might be occurring for a particular treatment, and where predictions might therefore be problematic.

To illustrate a situation in which this could be very informative, we can look at predictions for a quadratic time-course function fitted to the Obesity dataset:

```{r, fig.height=3, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
# Fit a quadratic time-course MBNMA to the Obesity dataset
network.obese <- mb.network(obesityBW_CFB, reference = "plac")

mbnma <- mb.run(network.obese,
                fun=tpoly(degree=2,
                          pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                          pool.2="rel", method.2="common"))

# Define stochastic values centred at zero for network reference treatment

mbnma <- mb.run(network.obese,
                fun=tpoly(degree=2,
                          pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                          pool.2="rel", method.2="common"), n.iter=3000)

# Plot predictions
plot(pred.obese, disp.obs = TRUE)
```

As you can see, within the limits of the observed data the predicted values appear reasonable. However, extrapolation beyond this for `dexf_30MG` leads to some rather strange results, suggesting an unrealistically huge increase in body weight after 50 weeks of treatment. On the other hand, the predicted response at 50 weeks follow-up in treatment 15 is within the limits of the observed data and so are likely to be more justifiable.


#### Plotting "lumped" NMA results

As a further addition to the plots of MBNMA predictions, it is possible to add predicted results from an NMA model or multiple "lumped" NMA models performed a different time "bins" (specified in `overlay.nma`), time periods within which we are assuming treatment effects are constant over time. This is similar to the output generated by `binplot()`. Either a `"random"` (the default) or `"common"` effects NMA can be specified, and model fit statistics are reported below the resulting plot.

This can be useful to assess if the MBNMA predictions are in agreement with predictions from lumped NMA models over a specific set of time-points, and can be a general indicator of the fit of the time-course model. However, it is important to note that the NMA model is not necessarily the more robust model, since it ignores potential differences in treatment effects that may arise from lumping time-points together. The wider the range specified in `overlay.nma`, the greater the effect of lumping and the stronger the assumption of similarity between studies.

The NMA predictions are plotted over the range specified in `overlay.nma` as a horizontal line representing the posterior median, with the 95%CrI shown by a shaded rectangle. The NMA predictions in theory represent those for *any time-points within this range* since they lump together data at all these time-points, though the width (x-axis) of the shaded rectangle represents the range of time-points for studies included in each time bin. Predictions for treatments that are disconnected from the network reference treatment at data points specified within `overlay.nma` cannot be estimated so are not included.

```{r, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
# Overlay predictions from lumped NMAs between 5-8 and between 8-15 weeks follow-up
plot(pred, overlay.nma=c(5,8,15), n.iter=20000)
```

## Consistency Testing

When performing an MBNMA by pooling relative treatment effects (`pool="rel"`), the modelling approach assumes consistency between direct and indirect evidence within a network. This is an incredibly useful assumption as it allows us to improve precision on existing direct estimates, or to estimate relative effects between treatments that have not been compared in head-to-head trials, by making use of indirect evidence.

However, if this assumption does not hold it is extremely problematic for inference, so it is important to be able to test it. A number of different approaches exist to allow for this in standard Network Meta-Analysis [@dias2013]. Two of these have been implemented within `MBNMAtime`. It is important to note that in some model specifications there is likely to be sharing of model parameters (e.g. heterogeneity parameters, correlation coefficients) across networks which will lead to more conservative tests for consistency, and may lead to an inflated type II error.

Consistency is also likely to differ depending on the model used. Failing to appropriately model the time-course function may in fact induce inconsistency in the data. "Lumping" together different time points from studies in standard NMA is known to be a potential cause of inconsistency, which is one of the reasons why accounting for time-course using MBNMA is important [@pedder2019]. When performing MBNMA, this is why it is important to first try to identify the best model possible in terms of time-course and common/random effects, and then to test for consistency within that model, rather than testing for consistency in models that are known not be be a good fit to the data.

Consistency testing can only be performed in networks in which closed loops of treatment comparisons exist that are drawn from independent sources of evidence. In networks which do not have any such loops of evidence, consistency cannot be formally tested (though it may still be present). The `mb.nodesplit.comparisons()` function identifies loops of evidence that conform to this property, and identifies a treatment comparison within that loop for which direct and indirect evidence can be compared using node-splitting (see below).

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Loops of evidence within the alogliptin dataset
splits.alog <- mb.nodesplit.comparisons(network.alog)
print(splits.alog)
```


### Unrelated Mean Effects (UME) models

To check for consistency using UME we fit a model that does not assume consistency relationships, and that only models the direct relative effects between each arm in a study and the study reference treatment. If the consistency assumption holds true then the results from the UME model and the MBNMA will be very similar. However, if there is a discrepancy between direct and indirect evidence in the network, then the consistency assumption may not be valid, and the UME results are likely differ in several ways:

* The UME model may provide a better fit to the data, as measured by deviance or residual deviance
* The between-study SD for different parameters may be lower in the UME model
* Individual relative effects may differ in magnitude or (more severely) in direction for different treatment comparisons between UME and MBNMA models

UME can be fitted to any time-course parameter which has been modelled using relative effects (`pool="rel"`). UME can be specified for each time-course parameter in separate analyses, or can be modelled all at once in a single analysis.

```{r, eval=FALSE, results="hide"}
# Identify quantile for knot at 0.5 weeks
timequant <- 0.5/max(network.pain$data.ab$time)

# Fit a B-spline MBNMA with common relative effects on slope.1 and slope.2
mbnma <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=tspline(type="bs", knots=timequant,
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2 = "rel", method.2="common"
                            ))

# Fit a UME model on both spline coefficients simultaneously
ume <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=tspline(type="bs", knots=timequant,
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2 = "rel", method.2="common"
                            ),
              UME=TRUE)

# Fit a UME model on the 1nd coefficient only
ume.slope.1 <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=tspline(type="bs", knots=timequant,
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2 = "rel", method.2="common"
                            ),
              UME="beta.1")

# Fit a UME model on the 2nd coefficient only
ume.slope.2 <- mb.run(network.pain,
                fun=tspline(type="bs", knots=timequant,
                            pool.1 = "rel", method.1="common",
                            pool.2 = "rel", method.2="common"
                            ),
              UME="beta.2")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Deviance for mbnma: -104.54")
print("Deviance for ume on beta.1 and beta.2: -115.5")
print("Deviance for ume on beta.1: -117.0")
print("Deviance for ume on beta.2: -115.2")
```

By comparing the deviance (or residual deviance) of models with UME fitted on different time-course parameters and the MBNMA model, we can see that there is some reduction in deviance in the different UME models. Given that deviance is lowest when UME is modelled only on `beta.1` this is suggestive of inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence on `beta.1`, but perhaps also on `beta.2` given that modelling UME on this also leads to a reduction in deviance.

Direct estimates from UME and MBNMA models can also be compared to examine in greater detail how inconsistency may be affecting results. However, it is important to note that whilst a discrepancy between UME and MBNMA results may be seen for a particular relative effect, the inconsistency is not exclusively applicable to that particular treatment comparison and may originate from other comparisons in the network. This is why consistency checking is so important, as a violation of the consistency assumption raises concerns about estimates for all treatments within the network.


### Node-splitting

```{r, include=FALSE}
load(system.file("extdata", "nodesplit.rda", package="MBNMAtime", mustWork = TRUE))
load(system.file("extdata", "ns.itp.rda", package="MBNMAtime", mustWork = TRUE))
```

Another approach for consistency checking is node-splitting. This splits contributions for a particular treatment comparison into direct and indirect evidence, and the two can then be compared to test their similarity. `mb.nodesplit()` takes similar arguments to `mb.run()` that define the underlying MBNMA model in which to test for consistency, and returns an object of `class("mb.nodesplit")`. There are two additional arguments required:

`comparisons` indicates on which treatment comparisons to perform a node-split. The default value for this is to automatically identify all comparisons for which both direct and indirect evidence contributions are available using `mb.nodesplit.comparisons()`.

`nodesplit.parameters` indicates on which time-course parameters to perform a node-split. This can only take time-course parameters that have been assigned relative effects in the model (`pool="rel"`). Alternatively the default `"all"` can be used to split on all available time-course parameters in the model that have been pooled using relative effects.

As up to two models will need to be run for each treatment comparison to split, this function can take some time to run.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Nodesplit using an Emax MBNMA
nodesplit <- mb.nodesplit(network.pain,
                          fun=temax(pool.emax="rel", method.emax = "random",
                                    pool.et50="abs", method.et50 = "common"),
                          nodesplit.parameters="all"
                          )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
save(nodesplit, file="inst/extdata/nodesplit.rda")
```
```{r}
print(nodesplit)
```

Performing the `print()` method on an object of `class("mb.nodesplit")` prints a summary of the node-split results to the console, whilst the `summary()` method will return a data frame of posterior summaries for direct and indirect estimates for each split treatment comparison and each time-course parameter. 

It is possible to generate different plots of each node-split comparison using `plot()`:

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.show="hold"}
# Plot forest plots of direct and indirect results for each node-split comparison
plot(nodesplit, plot.type="forest")

# Plot posterior densities of direct and indirect results for each node-split comparisons
plot(nodesplit, plot.type="density")
```

As a further example, if we use a different time-course function (1-parameter ITP) that is a less good fit for the data, and perform a node-split on the `rate` time-course parameter, we find that there seems to be a strong discrepancy between direct and indirect estimates. This is strong evidence to reject the consistency assumption, and to either (as in this case) try to identify a better fitting model, or to re-examine the dataset to try to explain whether differences in studies making different comparisons may be causing this.

This highlights the importance of testing for consistency *after* identifying an appropriate time-course and common/random treatment effects model.


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Nodesplit on emax of 1-parameter ITP MBNMA
ns.itp <- mb.nodesplit(network.pain,
                       fun=titp(pool.emax = "rel", method.emax="common"),
                       nodesplit.parameters="all")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
save(ns.itp, file="inst/extdata/ns.itp.rda")
```
```{r}
print(ns.itp)

plot(ns.itp, plot.type="forest")
```


## Conclusions

`MBNMAtime` provides a complete set of functions that allow for meta-analysis of longitudinal time-course data and plotting of a number of informative graphics. Functions are provided for ranking, prediction, and for assessing consistency when modelling using relative effects. By accounting for time-course in meta-analysis this can help to explain heterogeneity/inconsistency that may arise when lumping together different time-points using conventional NMA. 

The package allows for flexible modelling of either relative or absolute effects interchangeably on different time-course parameters within the same analysis, whilst providing a straightforward syntax with which to define these models.
